# Caesar-Shift-Cipher
This is a program that I wrote a few years ago which contains a Caesar Shift Cipher written in Java. 
Basically, a Caesar Shift Cipher takes each letter in a given string and shifts it a specified number of times.
The user can choose to encode or decode whatever text he or she inputs.
The user can also choose whether to only output a single shift, or all 26.
The code in this program is completely of my own design.
